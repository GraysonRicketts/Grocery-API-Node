What functionality do I want from the basket?
* Have items with
    * NAME
    * size / quantity
    * brand
    * number
    * department / category

* when mutliple of the same item are added
I want multiple of the items to be added
together if possible
    * if all properties but the 
    number are the same

Possible solutions:
1. Have all items have an ID or instance
in the database
2. Use all properties but the number to 
stack items

Pro | Con
1. Fast, easy to implement | all items must
have id or exist in DB, what to do with custom
items?
2. Conceptually simple mapping from
item to DB object, all items in one place
| Slow, hard to index / search, more code?

Just don't think 1 is possible. Seems impossible to ask client to know DB id of item or have one created.


-------
How do I think about items in a basket
basket = [basketItems = [Item]]
* Item is an individual descriptor of an item
    * idea have items have a created by so DB /
    my items are included with others but
    noted
